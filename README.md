# Data-Visualization
Data visualization projects that I have worked on include:
- <a href="https://observablehq.com/d/69cf5065a479d036">Visualizing Startup Trends Over Time by Industry, State, Region </a> 
- <a href="https://hhfinals.dgah.sites.carleton.edu/carleton-ocs-history/program-map/">Mapping Carleton's OCS Program History</a> using ArcGIS and WordPress. The folder *OCS Project CSV-formatting* contains data and data-formatting files for this project
